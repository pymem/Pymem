Foreword
========

Read this before you get started with Pymem.
This hopefully answers some questions about the purpose and goals of the project,
and then why you should and should not be using it.

Why Pymem ?
-----------

I decided to build pymem after some reading of the wonderfull book `Gray Hat Python
<https://nostarch.com/ghpython.htm>`_ by
Justin Seitz, which I recommend as a first reading before even starting using
Pymem.
The book covers the win32api and important aspects of debuggers.
As I wanted to learn more on debugging, hooking and the windows API, I figured out
that writing a library was the perfect project.

Pymem history
-------------

So back in 2010, with my little knowledge of Python I wrote the first version of
this library (which has been entirely rewritten since). I figured out that most
of the resources you can find covering C, C++, C# of the windows API works “as it”
using python ctypes_ without any effort, so I decided to wrap some of them into
Pymem.

In 2015, I decided to rebirth the library, and to rewrite it using python3.
The library is a toolbox for process memory manipulations, it supports memory reads,
writes and even assembly injection (thanks to pyfasm_).

.. _ctypes: https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/ctypes.html
.. _pyfasm: https://github.com/srounet/pyfasm


In 2020, the support for pyfasm was dropped because of its incompatibility with x64 processes.
It now includes testing, and the documentation as been totally rewritten with tutorials.

Why and when using Pymem
------------------------

Pymem has been built to reverse games such as World of Warcraft, so if you plan to
write a bot for this kind of game, you’re in the right place. You can also use
pymem to do injections, assembly, memory pattern search and a lot more.

You should head over the :doc:`tutorials/index` section and see what Pymem is capable of!
